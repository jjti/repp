## repp annotate

Annotate a circular sequence using features (comma-separated)

### Synopsis

Accepts a sequence file as input and runs alignment against the
embedded feature database. Each alignment feature is included as
a feature in the output: a Genbank file. Individual databases
can be selected, in which case the entries in the database will
be used in the alignment _rather_ than the feature database.

The feature database and the default 96% identity are based on
information from [SnapGene](https://www.snapgene.com/resources/plasmid-files/)
